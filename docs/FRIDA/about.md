# About FRIDA

FRIDA is a Slurm cluster that was initially set up with the help of the Development of Slovene in the Digital Environment (RSDO) project in 2020 when the first [NVIDIA DGX-A100](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxa100-user-guide/) system was acquired. Later it was upgraded with a new and more capable login node, and two compute nodes with 8 80GB/GPU GPUs each, one of them being an [NVIDIA DGX-H100](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxh100-user-guide/).

FRIDA is progressively further expanded. For example in Q2 of 2024, attention was given to future/alternative technologies, with the addition of development kit compute nodes equipped with AMD MI210 GPUs as well as NVIDIA GraceHopper Superchips. Later expansions concentrated on faster InfiniBand data interconnect, a fast and larger shared data storage based on the Weka Data Platform. The most recent addition is a [NVIDIA DGX-B200](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxb200-user-guide/) with 8 180GB/GPU Blackwell GPUs that are interconnected with the 1.8TB/s 5th gen NVLink+NVSwitch.

Research labs that own and manage their computing systems themselves, may inquire about the possibility of integrating their infrastructure into FRIDA. Cofunding of future FRIDA expansions is also possible. All inquiries should be addressed to the UL FRI Management Board, the technical details will be coordinated by the FRIDA technical committee.

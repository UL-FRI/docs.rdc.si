# About FRIDA

As part of its strategy to support its own researchers in their endeavorus University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Comptuer and Information Science (UL FRI) actively invests into resarch infrastructure. In the summer of 2023 one such investment was the expansion of an existing, homegrown, SLURM cluster with additional hardware. The SLURM cluster was initially setup with the help of the Development of Slovene in the Digital Environment (RSDO) project in 2020, when the first [NVIDIA DGX-A100](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxa100-user-guide/) system was accquired. The most recent expansion consists a new and more capable login node, and two compute nodes with 8 80GB/GPU GPUs each, one of them being an [NVIDIA DGX-H100](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgxh100-user-guide/), the currenlty most capable and saught after NVIDIA DGX system. To mark this expansion the SLURM cluster was renamed to FRIDA.

In the near future FRIDA is planned to be further expanded. For example in Q1 of 2024 attention will be given to future/alternative technologies, with the addition of development kit compute nodes equipped with AMD MI210 GPUs as well as NVIDIA GraceHopper superchips. Later expansions will concentrate on faster Infiniband data interconnect, faster and larger shared data storage, as well as additional compute nodes.

Research labs who own and manage their own compute systems may inquire about the possibility to integrate their infrastructure into FRIDA. Cofunding of future FRIDA expansions is also possible. All inquiries should be addressed to the UL FRI Management board, the technical details will be coordinated by the FRIDA technical committee.

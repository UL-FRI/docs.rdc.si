# About FRIKA

FRIKA consists of three NVIDIA HGX Redstone GPU servers specifically dedicated to inferencing. The principal goal is to provide infrastructure for researchers and laboratories that want to offer their solutions (models/applications) as web services and thus promote their research/development work at UL FRI.

FRIKA is currently running as a system of individual nodes that provide resources via Incus virtual machines and/or containers. Depending on requirements it is planned to be progressively further expanded. A long-term plan is to port all services to a Kubernetes-based cluster.

Research labs that own and manage their inferencing systems themselves, may inquire about the possibility of integrating their infrastructure into FRIKA. Cofunding of future FRIKA expansions is also possible. All inquiries should be addressed to the UL FRI Management Board, the technical details will be coordinated by the FRIKA technical committee.

# About FRIKA

As part of its strategy to support its researchers in their endeavor the University of Ljubljana, Faculty of Computer and Information Science ([UL FRI](https://www.fri.uni-lj.si)) actively invests in research infrastructure. In the summer of 2023, one such investment was the acquisition of three NVIDIA HGX Redstone GPU servers to be specifically dedicated to inferencing. The principal goal is to provide infrastructure for researchers and laboratories that want to offer their solutions (models/applications) as web services and thus promote their research/development work at UL FRI. The three-node setup was named FRIKA.

FRIKA is currently running as a system of individual nodes that provide resources via Incus virtual machines and/or containers. Depending on requirements it is planned to be progressively further expanded. A possible transition to a k8s-based solution is also being actively investigated.

Research labs that own and manage their inferencing systems themselves, may inquire about the possibility of integrating their infrastructure into FRIKA. Cofunding of future FRIKA expansions is also possible. All inquiries should be addressed to the UL FRI Management Board, the technical details will be coordinated by the FRIKA technical committee.
